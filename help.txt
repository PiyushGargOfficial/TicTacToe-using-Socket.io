a.This tictactoe is coded without the use rooms in socket.io thats why more than 2 people can join and hinder the game.

b.Also since there is no way to restrict players ,similarly there is no way to restrict who plays whose turn without rooms.(i currently dont know)

c.The data inside the tictactoe columns vanishes if one player reloads .(this is solved in the new version checkout their -v2)

If you know any solution without use of rooms ,email me at
